	 <p> </p><h1>Welcome to Femi's World</h1><p></p> My name is Femi Martins Areola, an upcoming <strong>Web Designer.</strong> <p></p> I'm a student of <em>Sociology</em>,<font face="arial" size="3" color="black"> and I have a strong interest in history and political economy.</font>. <br> <p> My favourite word is "Massive", and my favourite statement is <u> <strong> <em>"Come now, and let us reason together (Isaiah 1:18)" </em> </strong> </u>
	 </p> 
	 Sometimes I can be nice and very pleasing to talk to. <br> Other times, I could be headstrong and <strike> obstinate</strike>. &nbsp; That's just how I am; Take it or leave it. <br>
	 I have a lot of interests, and perhaps my greatest talent is that I can hold my own in conversations about a wide range of things. <h3>Some of these interests, and why I'm interested in them include;</h3>

     </ul>
      

     <a id="Sports"> </a><p>Sports: From childhood, I've always been interested in sports and sporting activities. I remember winning prizes for my school in Athletics (Hard to believe, huh?) and also going out to play football, even at the risk of getting whooped by my dad. Till today, I remain an avid sports follower and I have special interest in football, boxing and basketball.</p>
     <a id="Politics"></a><p>Politics: Ironically, as a child, I detested politics. A little guy who heard all the adults around him blame politicians for every problem in the country could not have any love for them. I remember that when elderly people around me said prayers like "In this gathering we'll have future Governors, CEOs, Ministers etc", I always said God forbid to being Governor and Minister (Isn't that amusing.) My interest in politics came pretty naturally, I must admit. It just happened. However, I remember that watching "24" as well as watching the second inauguration of President Obama and the 2015 inauguration of President Buhari strenghtened my resolve to one day go into politics. </p>
     <a id="History"> </a><p>History: This is the first subject that came naturally to me as a human being. At the risk of sounding immodest, I'm good in history and historical events. As late as my SS2, I was SERIOUSLY considering reading History in the University. Having a good memory helps in my Massive knowledge of history. I mean, I can easily tell you the name of every of the 45 Presidents the United States of America has ever had, with their time in office as well as major events that occurred in their tenure (Although you'll have to pay me for that). I can tell you about the events that led up to World War 2 and give you an accurate timeline of the Cold War. I can tell you the name of every Aare Ona Kakanfo in Yoruba history, and tell you the name of Okonkwo's mother's village in Things Fall Apart (Pun intended). Need I say more?</p>
     <a id="Arts"> </a><p>Arts: My love for Art is expressed most notably in paintings/ Books. I really love looking at paintings, and usually spend time thinking of storylines on what they might mean. About books, I do boast to friends that I read everything. I'm an avid reader, and I find it difficult to drop a book till I'm done reading it. Sadly, I don't think I have the level of concentration required to delve fully into the arts.</p>
     <a id="Entertainment"> </a><p>Entertainment: Entertainment has always been all around me. As a child, I was constantly serenaded by Wasiu Ayinde and his Fuji music. My sister was (is) a Beyonce freak, and she introduced me to several other musicians. This extensive background is helpful, seeing as I listen to all genres of music. However, my love for music did not trascend to movies. I rarely watch movies that aren't biopics or depict an historical event. However, I'm a Bond fan, and I have a thing for action movies.</p>
     <a id="Espionage"> </a><p> Espionage: Being a Bond fan, this is natural. My love for espionage began after I read that the CIA'S unofficial motto is John 8:32 (Yeah, check it up). Anyway, I know a lot about the Espionage world, and I am always fascinated reading about the face offs between the KGB and CIA during the Cold War. Mossad is also a very badass intel agency, and the rescuing of the hostages at the Entebe Airport, Uganda is always interesting to read about. Sadly, the Nigerian intel agency, NIA, has no massive accomplishments to its name, which is a sad thing.  </p>
     <a id="Economy"> </a><p> Economy: Economics seems to be a very broad discipline, one that encompasses various sub disciplines (Like Sociology). I'm actively trying to understand the way the Chinese system works. It's really amazing the way the country lifted  hundreds of millions of its citizens from poverty. I'm sure a country like Nigeria can learn from China in our attempt (Half hearted attempt, I must say) to lift our citizens out of poverty. </p>
     <a id="Diplomacy"> </a><p> Diplomacy: Diplomacy/ international relations is a very interesting discipline to me. My new pastime is studying the works of great diplomats such as Henry Kissinger and Zhou Enlai. I don't think I'll make a great diplomat though. I'm not cut for that sort of stuff. However though, diplomacy is very important in resolving conflicts.</p>
     In addition to my interests, I also have some abilities that make me awesome. These abilities make others gasp and confers this somewhat "smart ass" on me (That's nonsense though. I'm a dumbo.)
     <h3>These "special" abilities are;</h3> 
     <ol>
     <li> Ability to read fast; I'm probably the fastest reader you know</li>
     <li> I have an avid memory. I remember the most insignificant things</li>
     <li> I'm able to make things happen without appearing to put in much of an effort</li>
     <li> I'm good with words. It's probably my biggest ability</li>
     <li> I am able to switch roles comfortably. Scholar today, THUG LIFE tomorrow.</li>
     </ol> <br>As a student of the Faculty of Social Sciences, I have made for myself a lot of friends, few adversaries and no public enemy (All those who hate me are too afraid of my Greatness to cross me publicly, I guess). Anyway, to friend, adversary and enemy alike, there is only one message there need to keep in mind; 
     <h1>I am The King</h1>
     <p>

	 </p>
	 To put it in a more general term, I'm so skillful that I dribble past my opponents and leave them in limbo, where they lament after I reach the peak of my career, wearing three crowns. Surely, nothing can bring me low.
	In case you don't understand, <h1>here's a video explaining what I mean</h1>
